#  👥 Cohort Analysis App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://cohort.streamlitapp.com/)

This Cohort Analysis App calculates the `retention rate` (the percentage of active customers compared to the total number of customers, split by month). This `retention rate` is then visualized and interpreted through a heatmap.

These 	2 demos are based on the following tutorials:
